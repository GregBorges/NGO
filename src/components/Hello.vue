    h1.hello Coming Soon!
    p Nonprofiters will be a social platform for social causes, based on my previous project "<a href="https://stemlet-9527e.firebaseapp.com"><strong>Stemlet:</strong></a> The Yellow Pages for those in Need".
    p This is a passion project, as I've experienced homelessness myself. In fact, it's largely what inspired Stemlet, and how I know for certain that this project will leave an impact as well.
    p If you'd like to get involved, you totally can! Whether you're <a href="https://trello.com/b/Jopi5Zxg/development">a developer</a>, artist, or just love nonprofits there's something for anyone of any experience and background to do.
